## About Me

Hi, I'm Daniel! I'm currently a PhD student in Physics at Queen's University under the supervison of Prof. Gabriele De Chiara. My current research project focuses on the energetic resources required for Quantum Machine Learning models, and I've been delving into quantum algorithms using Qiskit, Pennylane, and QIBO. Also, I am a mebmer of the Quantum Technology at Queens group (QTeQ).

When I'm not working on quantum computing or tutoring, I enjoy mending, fixing, and enivetbly screaming at my cars
