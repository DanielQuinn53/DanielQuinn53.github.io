## About Me

Hi, I'm Daniel! I'm a PhD student in Physics at Queen's University Belfast, working under the supervision of Prof. Gabriele De Chiara. My research focuses on the energetic resources required for Quantum Machine Learning models. I have been actively exploring quantum algorithms using Qiskit, Pennylane, and QIBO. Additionally, I am a proud member of the Quantum Technology at Queens group (QTeQ).

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy tinkering with my cars—mending, fixing, and occasionally screaming at them when things don’t go as planned!
