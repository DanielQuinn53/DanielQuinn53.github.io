# About Me

Hi, I'm Daniel! I'm currently a PhD student in Physics at Queen's University, specializing in Quantum Machine Learning. My research focuses on the energetic resources required for quantum models, and I've been delving into quantum algorithms using Qiskit, Pennylane, and QIBO.

In addition to my research, I tutor a year-long first-year university module on Real Analysis and Linear Algebra, where I help students consolidate their understanding with weekly summaries and homework assistance. I also have experience as a marker for a second-year module on Complex Analysis and Partial Differential Equations, where I graded homework assignments and provided feedback.

When I'm not working on quantum computing or tutoring, I enjoy exploring new technologies, always advancing my understanding of physics and mathematics.
